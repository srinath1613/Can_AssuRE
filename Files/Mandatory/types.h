     * HVAC Properties

     * Additional rules for mapping a zoned HVAC property (except
     * HVAC_MAX_DEFROST_ON) to AreaIDs:
     *  - Every seat in VehicleAreaSeat that is available in the car, must be
     *    part of an AreaID in the AreaID array.
     *
     * Example 1: A car has two front seats (ROW_1_LEFT, ROW_1_RIGHT) and three
     *  back seats (ROW_2_LEFT, ROW_2_CENTER, ROW_2_RIGHT). There are two
     *  temperature control units -- driver side and passenger side.
     *   - A valid mapping set of AreaIDs for HVAC_TEMPERATURE_SET would be a
     *     two element array:
     *      - ROW_1_LEFT  | ROW_2_LEFT
     *      - ROW_1_RIGHT | ROW_2_CENTER | ROW_2_RIGHT
     *   - An alternative mapping for the same hardware configuration would be:
     *      - ROW_1_LEFT  | ROW_2_CENTER | ROW_2_LEFT
     *      - ROW_1_RIGHT | ROW_2_RIGHT
     *  The temperature controllers are assigned to the seats which they
     *  "most influence", but every seat must be included exactly once. The
     *  assignment of the center rear seat to the left or right AreaID may seem
     *  arbitrary, but the inclusion of every seat in exactly one AreaID ensures
     *  that the seats in the car are all expressed and that a "reasonable" way
     *  to affect each seat is available.
     *
     * Example 2: A car has three seat rows with two seats in the front row (ROW_1_LEFT,
     *  ROW_1_RIGHT) and three seats in the second (ROW_2_LEFT, ROW_2_CENTER,
     *  ROW_2_RIGHT) and third rows (ROW_3_LEFT, ROW_3_CENTER, ROW_3_RIGHT). There
     *  are three temperature control units -- driver side, passenger side, and rear.
     *   - A reasonable way to map HVAC_TEMPERATURE_SET to AreaIDs is a three
     *     element array:
     *     - ROW_1_LEFT
     *     - ROW_1_RIGHT

     *
     * For example, should bytes[0] = 0x4C (0b01001100) it would mean that:

     *   int32Values[2 and 3] are valid sensor values

     *   floatValues[0 thru 3] are not valid sensor values

     *
     * This property is called by the Android system when it initializes and it lets the HAL
     * define which Android user should be started.
     *
     * This request is made by setting a VehiclePropValue (defined by InitialUserInfoRequest),

     * If the HAL doesn't respond after some time (defined by the Android system), the Android
     * system will proceed as if HAL returned a response of action
     * InitialUserInfoResponseAction:DEFAULT.
     *
     * For example, on first boot, the request could be:
     *
     * int32[0]: 42  // request id (arbitrary number set by Android system)
     * int32[1]: 1   // InitialUserInfoRequestType::FIRST_BOOT
     * int32[2]: 0   // id of current user (usersInfo.currentUser.userId)

     * int32[6]: 1   // flags of user #0  (usersInfo.existingUsers[0].flags)
     *
     * And if the HAL want to respond with the creation of an admin user called "Owner", the
     * response would be:
     *
     * int32[0]: 42      // must match the request id from the request
     * int32[1]:  2      // action = InitialUserInfoResponseAction::CREATE
     * int32[2]: -10000  // userToSwitchOrCreate.userId (not used as user will be created)
     * int32[3]:  8      // userToSwitchOrCreate.flags = ADMIN
     * string: "||Owner" // userLocales + separator + userNameToCreate
     *
     * Notice the string value represents multiple values, separated by ||. The first value is the
     * (optional) system locales for the user to be created (in this case, it's empty, meaning it
     * will use Android's default value), while the second value is the (also optional) name of the
     * to user to be created (when the type of response is InitialUserInfoResponseAction:CREATE).
     * For example, to create the same "Owner" user with "en-US" and "pt-BR" locales, the string

     * name can have || on it, although a single | is fine.

     * 1.LEGACY_ANDROID_SWITCH
     * -----------------------
     *
     * Called by the Android System to indicate the Android user is about to change, when the change
     * request was made in a way that is not integrated with the HAL (for example, through
     * adb shell am switch-user).
     *
     * The HAL can switch its internal user once it receives this request, but it doesn't need to
     * reply back to the Android System. If its internal user cannot be changed for some reason,
     * then it must wait for the SWITCH_USER(type=ANDROID_POST_SWITCH) call to recover
     * (for example, it could issue a SWITCH_USER(type=VEHICLE_REQUEST) to switch back to
     * the previous user), but ideally it should never fail (as switching back could result in a
     * confusing experience for the end user).
     *
     * For example, if the system have users (0, 10, 11) and it's switching from 0 to 11 (where none
     * of them have any special flag), the request would be:
     *
     * int32[0]:  42  // request id
     * int32[1]:  1   // SwitchUserMessageType::LEGACY_ANDROID_SWITCH
     * int32[2]:  11  // target user id
     * int32[3]:  0   // target user flags (none)
     * int32[4]:  10  // current user
     * int32[5]:  0   // current user flags (none)
     * int32[6]:  3   // number of users
     * int32[7]:  0   // user #0 (Android user id 0)
     * int32[8]:  0   // flags of user #0 (none)
     * int32[9]:  10  // user #1 (Android user id 10)
     * int32[10]: 0   // flags of user #1 (none)
     * int32[11]: 11  // user #2 (Android user id 11)
     * int32[12]: 0   // flags of user #2 (none)
     *
     * 2.ANDROID_SWITCH
     * ----------------
     * Called by the Android System to indicate the Android user is about to change, but Android
     * will wait for the HAL's response (up to some time) before proceeding.
     *
     * The HAL must switch its internal user once it receives this request, then respond back to
     * Android with a SWITCH_USER(type=VEHICLE_RESPONSE) indicating whether its internal
     * user was switched or not (through the SwitchUserStatus enum).
     *
     * For example, if Android has users (0, 10, 11) and it's switching from 10 to 11 (where
     * none of them have any special flag), the request would be:
     *
     * int32[0]:  42  // request id
     * int32[1]:  2   // SwitchUserMessageType::ANDROID_SWITCH
     * int32[2]:  11  // target user id
     * int32[3]:  0   // target user flags (none)
     * int32[4]:  10  // current user
     * int32[5]:  0   // current user flags (none)
     * int32[6]:  3   // number of users
     * int32[7]:  0   // 1st user (user 0)
     * int32[8]:  1   // 1st user flags (SYSTEM)
     * int32[9]:  10  // 2nd user (user 10)
     * int32[10]: 0   // 2nd user flags (none)
     * int32[11]: 11  // 3rd user (user 11)
     * int32[12]: 0   // 3rd user flags (none)
     *
     * If the request succeeded, the HAL must update the propery with:
     *
     * int32[0]: 42  // request id
     * int32[1]: 3   // messageType = SwitchUserMessageType::VEHICLE_RESPONSE
     * int32[2]: 1   // status = SwitchUserStatus::SUCCESS
     *
     * But if it failed, the response would be something like:
     *
     * int32[0]: 42   // request id
     * int32[1]: 3    // messageType = SwitchUserMessageType::VEHICLE_RESPONSE
     * int32[2]: 2    // status = SwitchUserStatus::FAILURE
     * string: "108-D'OH!" // OEM-spefic error message
     *
     * 3.VEHICLE_RESPONSE
     * ------------------
     * Called by the HAL to indicate whether a request of type ANDROID_SWITCH should proceed or
     * abort - see the ANDROID_SWITCH section above for more info.
     *
     * 4.VEHICLE_REQUEST
     * ------------------
     * Called by the HAL to request that the current foreground Android user is switched.
     *
     * This is useful in situations where Android started as one user, but the vehicle identified
     * the driver as another user. For example, user A unlocked the car using the key fob of user B;
     * the INITIAL_USER_INFO request returned user B, but then a face recognition subsubsystem
     * identified the user as A.
     *
     * The HAL makes this request by a property change event (passing a negative request id), and
     * the Android system will response by issue an ANDROID_POST_SWITCH call which the same
     * request id.
     *
     * For example, if the current foreground Android user is 10 and the HAL asked it to switch to
     * 11, the request would be:
     *
     * int32[0]: -108  // request id
     * int32[1]: 4     // messageType = SwitchUserMessageType::VEHICLE_REQUEST
     * int32[2]: 11    // Android user id
     *
     * If the request succeeded and Android has 3 users (0, 10, 11), the response would be:
     *
     * int32[0]: -108 // request id
     * int32[1]:  5   // messageType = SwitchUserMessageType::ANDROID_POST_SWITCH
     * int32[2]:  11  // target user id
     * int32[3]:  0   // target user id flags (none)
     * int32[4]:  11  // current user
     * int32[5]:  0   // current user flags (none)
     * int32[6]:  3   // number of users
     * int32[7]:  0   // 1st user (user 0)
     * int32[8]:  0   // 1st user flags (none)
     * int32[9]:  10  // 2nd user (user 10)
     * int32[10]: 4   // 2nd user flags (none)
     * int32[11]: 11  // 3rd user (user 11)
     * int32[12]: 3   // 3rd user flags (none)
     *
     * Notice that both the current and target user ids are the same - if the request failed, then
     * they would be different (i.e, target user would be 11, but current user would still be 10).
     *
     * 5.ANDROID_POST_SWITCH
     * ---------------------
     * Called by the Android System after a request to switch a user was made.
     *
     * This property is called after switch requests of any type (i.e., LEGACY_ANDROID_SWITCH,
     * ANDROID_SWITCH, or VEHICLE_REQUEST) and can be used to determine if the request succeeded or
     * failed:
     *
     * 1. When it succeeded, it's called when the Android user is in the unlocked state and the
     *    value of the current and target users ids in the response are the same. This would be
     *    equivalent to receiving an Intent.ACTION_USER_UNLOCKED in an Android app.
     * 2. When it failed it's called right away and the value of the current and target users ids
     *    in the response are different (as the current user didn't change to the target).
     * 3. If a new switch request is made before the HAL responded to the previous one or before
     *    the user was unlocked, then the ANDROID_POST_SWITCH request is not made. For example,
     *    the driver could accidentally switch to the wrong user which has lock credentials, then
     *    switch to the right one before entering the credentials.
     *
     * The HAL can update its internal state once it receives this request, but it doesn't need to
     * reply back to the Android System.
     *
     * Request: the first N values as defined by INITIAL_USER_INFO (where the request-specific
     * value at index 1 is SwitchUserMessageType::ANDROID_POST_SWITCH), then 2 more values for the
     * target user id (i.e., the Android user id that was requested to be switched to) and its flags
     * (as defined by  UserFlags).
     *
     * Response: none.
     *
     * Example: see VEHICLE_REQUEST section above.

     * without defining it. In fact, this property could be used without supporting the core
     * user-related functions described on INITIAL_USER_INFO.

     * To query the association, the Android system gets the property, passing a VehiclePropValue

     * already identified association (like the key FOB used to unlock the car), instead of starting
